Retrieval Augmented Generation is a technique that enhances large language models
by retrieving relevant external information before generating a response. It
combines vector-based search with natural language generation to reduce
hallucinations and improve factual accuracy.

RAG systems store documents as vector embeddings and retrieve them using semantic
similarity. The retrieved documents are injected into the prompt of the language
model, grounding its output in real data.
